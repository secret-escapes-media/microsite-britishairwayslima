        <h4>How and why did you first get into 360 Photography?</h4>
        <p>I’ve been taking photos since childhood, but really got hooked around 1994 when I got hold of the Apple QuickTake, one of the very first digital cameras. I’ve always been fascinated by panoramic and 360 formats, and early on specialised in this. </p>
        <p>The 360 format really allows the viewer to experience a location. I love shooting unusual places or making the mundane fascinating by planning for the right light and conditions.</p>

        <h4>How much planning goes into a 360 shoot? Do you have an idea of what you want before you are even in the country, or do you see where it takes you?</h4>
        <p>A trip like this required a great deal of planning in advance, both through desktop research and working with travel planners on the ground in Peru before we even left the UK. The plan had some ‘definites’ that we knew we wanted to include, but as with any shoot like this, there always has to be flexibility built into the schedule. If you see something that’s worth shooting, you have to be able to divert and capture that without feeling like you’re losing the opportunity to shoot something else.</p>

        <h4>If you hadn’t been a photographer, what would you have done?</h4>
        <p>A landscape gardener – being outdoors in all conditions, having patience, waiting for the right weather, applying creativity to nature, there are perhaps parallels to photography…</p>

        <h4>What are your favourite kinds of destinations to photograph 360 in?</h4>
        <p>Places which offer epic scenery are always very rewarding for me. I love shooting in California, as you can go from snow-capped mountains to beaches, deserts to redwood forests, lakes to cities, all within a day or two. I live in London and never tire of shooting the London cityscape – it’s so vast with so much to take in, that it really lends itself to the panoramic format. Peru is an incredible opportunity for any photographer, the sheer scale of Machu Picchu is just jaw-dropping. </p>

        <h4>What was your best moment on the shoot in Peru?</h4>
        <p>Machu Picchu was epic and has to go down as one of the greatest locations in Peru. We visited Mullak’as-Misminay in the Sacred Valley of the Incas. The warmth and kindness of the villagers and the insight they offer into ancient Andean life created some very special memories. </p>

        <h4>What would you do after the shoot to wind down?</h4>
        <p>There are plenty of good bars and restaurants, especially in Lima and Cusco. We couldn’t resist going for a pint of Guinness at the highest Irish Bar in the world, in Cusco’s main square.</p>
        <p>In general, the food is amazing. As an end-of-shoot tradition, we always try to have a bite to eat and a couple of beers. So, after a long day shooting, a quick search on Trip Advisor for a nearby restaurant revealed that one of the best sushi restaurants in the world was just down the road! We were lucky to get in without reservations and can confirm that it’s every bit as good as its reviews suggest. </p>
        <p>My assistant’s daughters have pet guinea pigs, and so we couldn’t quite bring ourselves to try the roadside snacks! </p>

        <h4>What specific advice would you give someone travelling to Peru?</h4>
        <p>Take some time to understand what affects altitude could have on you. On arrival at Cusco we didn’t have the time to acclimatize to the altitude and while we weren’t hit hard, it was definitely a consideration. It can take it out of you, so if you can give yourselves a few days to increase height gradually, you should find it much easier. The locals recommend drinking coca tea, and we found this helped. </p>
        <p>Take good sunblock and a hat too – it’s easier to get sunburned at high altitude.</p>

        <h4>What can you recommend for people travelling to Peru to try and capture?</h4>
        <p>Put your camera down and don’t be one of those tourists that spend their time waving their selfie sticks around. There is too much to experience to spend time looking at your camera or phone!  Some specific tips:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>you will end up having to carry your camera gear at altitude, so keep it lightweight</p></li>
          <li><p>in Cusco, you will see people in traditional dress (often with llamas and alpacas), they expect to be paid to be photographed, so it’s polite to chat with them before shooting anything </p></li>
          <li><p>it’s worth getting up very early to shoot Machu Picchu as it can get very busy later in the day</p></li>
          <li><p>stick to restricted areas at Machu Picchu, accidents do happen and you’ll get great images from the permitted areas.</p></li>
        </ol>
