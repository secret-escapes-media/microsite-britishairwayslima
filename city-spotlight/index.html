        <h3>Lima</h3>
        <p>As the capital of of Peru, Lima is a hotbed of activity,a bustling metropolis where market vendors shout their wares and city workers pile into a network of bars and upmarket restaurants. From Franciscan Monasteries to Spanish colonial architecture, Lima juxtaposes its past with modern high rises and contemporary nightlife. Head over to the upscale Miraflores district, for trendy bars, great restaurants and buzzing discos, and a host of great markets to score some bargains and regional produce. Head to the coast to El Malecón, for bike rides along the Pacific coast and parks full of contemporary art.</p>
        <p>Further south lies the Barranco district. Once the reserve of the wealthy, it soon became the bohemian quarter, packed with writers, artists, and creatives. Now it’s a romantic collection of sleepy cafes, art deco grandeur, and exceptional nightlife. Seek out the Bridge of Sighs, for a truly romantic evening spot. </p>

        <h3>Cusco</h3>
        <p>The ancient Inca capital is a powerhouse of history and culture, delicately threaded with a modernity that allows for luxury stays and cool nights out. Known as the gateway to Andean culture, it’s the perfect spot to adjust to the high climes of the Andes, before exploring Machu Picchu and the large selection of other fascinating archeological sites. Aside from stunning colonial architecture, Cusco is a fascinating study in the historic cultural shifts of the area; where else can you see people in traditional Andean clothing leading a llama in one hand with a smartphone in the other?</p>
        <p>A closer look reveals churches built on Inca foundations, and hotels in former historic buildings. Tradition seeps into the modern, where fine dining restaurants serve classics such as roasted guinea pigs and alpaca steaks. Throw in a few great bars, the opportunity to try some excellent pisco, and a host of craft shops selling that perfect Andean knit, and you have an unmissable destination ripe for exploring.</p>
