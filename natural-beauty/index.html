        <h2>From the Pacific coast to Andean peaks</h2>
        <p>Peru is a landscape of dramatic change. From the glacial ranges of the Andes, the tropical density of the Amazon, and the golden beaches that are lapped by the warm Pacific, Peru is a place of astounding natural beauty with diversity unlike anywhere else in the world. Take for example the lush, sweeping landscape of The Sacred Valley, a collection of isolated villages and Inca treasures – most notably the ancient citadels of Písac and Ollantaytambo – a must for adventurers and history lovers. Or for an experience teeming with rich biodiversity, fly into the Peruvian Amazon (for there are no roads!) and attempt to untangle the dense jungle, while jaguars, monkeys and snakes skate around the thick mess of roots and branches. </p>

        <h3>The Birthplace of the Sun </h3>
        <p>The Maras Salt Mines should not go unvisited. These ancient salt pans have been used for the past five centuries to mine salt in the Sacred Valley, and form a landscape that is wholly unique, and vividly enthralling.</p>

        <h3>Unimaginable landscapes</h3>
        <p>It’s not difficult to see why old Andean belief claims this marvel, Lake Titicaca, to be the birthplace of the sun. Its vast, shimmering blue waters span across the plateau from Peru to Bolivia, making it the largest lake in South America and the highest navigable body of water on the planet. It’s shores and small islands play host to remnants of traditional Andean culture, from straw built houses to iconic straw boats. Reed floating villages remain from Inca times, making Titicaca a great spot for sinking your teeth into tradition, with a stunning backdrop to boot.</p>

        <h3>Venture deep into the Amazon</h3>
        <p>No visit to Peru is complete without witnessing the incredible biodiversity of the Amazon. Its size and density dwarfs explorers who (with a guide, of course) take on the tangle of roots and branches to experience it. Jaguars, anteaters, monkeys and snakes share this precious habitat, as well as many thousands of plant species. Head deeper in into the Amazonian jungle to experience Iquitos, the largest city within the peruvian rainforest which can only be accessed by boat or plane..</p>
