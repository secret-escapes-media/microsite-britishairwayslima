        <h2>Trailblaze through epic landscapes</h2>
        <p>This vast land is something of a nirvana for adventuring types. Take on the dense Amazon for back-to-nature thrills on foot and over water, make for the coast to kayak and surf on the turquoise Pacific, venture into the Andes for mountain biking against a staggeringly scenic backdrop and lose yourself in one of many riotous Peruvian festivals.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, why not try your hand at paragliding and fly with the birds, enjoy spectacular views over the Pacific Ocean and Lima. Or if you would rather keep your feet firmly on the ground then you can sand board in Huacachina. This little town is desert oasis and playground alike, speed up and down the dunes in a buggy before taking to a board the to surf the dunes.</p>

An unmissable experience, it climbs a breath-taking 4,829 metres in six hours, passing through a tapestry of green valleys, mining towns and glassy lakes.</p>
